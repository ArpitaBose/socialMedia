# SocialMedia
# About The Project
Design a simple Social Media application(Maven Project). 

Users should be able to: 

1.       create new posts

2.       follow/unfollow another user

3.       view the 20 most recent posts in the user's news feed.

Your design should support the following methods:

createPost(userId, postId, content): Compose a new post.

getNewsFeed(userId): Retrieve the 20 most recent post ids in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted either by one of the userâ€™s followees or by the user herself. Posts must be ordered by posting time starting from the most recent one.

follow(followerId, followeeId): Follower follows a followee.

unfollow(followerId, followeeId): Follower unfollows a followee.
